      <span class = 'pHeader'>Formula 1 Points System</span>
      <p>The Formula 1 points system stands as the definitive measure of success in this high-octane motorsport. Serving as a quantifiable reflection of a team's performance, the points earned in each race propel teams and drivers toward championship titles and podium glory. This complicated system not only rewards speed but also consistency, strategy, and adaptability, making it a crucial element of the sport's drama and intrigue. There are two point championships: the Constructors' Championship and the Driver's Championship.</p>

      <span class = 'pHeader'>Point Distribution</span>
      <p>When the checkered flag waves at the end of a Formula 1 race, points are awarded to drivers based on their finishing positions. The winner receives 25 points, the second place 18 points, then 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1 points. The points then descend incrementally through the field, with the tenth-place finisher earning the final point. These points reflect not only speed but also the strategic decisions, precision, and endurance required to navigate the challenges of the race.</p>
