# F1-Guide
This is the first website I created after completing CIS*1050 Web Design &amp; Development. Inspired by my passion for the fast-paced sport, F1. This website is purely HTML and CSS, as it was to practice the basics of web development upon completion of the starter course on web design &amp; development.
